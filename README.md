# sharelite
Pioneer Hackathon github repo code.

Given the lockdown due to corona, most of the people are working from home.
And one of the most common requirement while working online is,
sharing screen in a video call to present something.

If you are presenting some text to your colleagues, 
the poor video quality due to low bandwidth makes it hard to read.

This project aims to build the solution to this common problem
by prefetching the content in every client connected to the meeting.
